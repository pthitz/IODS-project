## Data 
    dat <- read.csv("D:/MOOC-kurssi/IODS-project/data/lrn14_dat.csv") 
    str(dat)
    summary(dat$age)  
    summary(dat$points)  
Dataset is a summary of questionnaire results from 166 students who completed the exam, for which *gender* (M=male, F=female), *age* (17-55 years), and exam results (*points*, on the range 7-33) is known. The questionnaire included questions measuring attitude and different learning strategies (deep, surface, or strategic learning). Corresponding summary variables *deep*, *surf* and *stra* have been transformed to equal scale by taking rowmeans (by calculating means for each of all questions measuring that specific learning strategy, separately for each student.)   
*Gender* is coded as **factor** and other variables as **numeric**.
