# About the project

### Feeling right now
I think I drank too much tea while doing the first set of DataCamp exercises.  

### Hopes/expectations for the course
* My original motivation for taking the course stems from the fact that although I have already for a while used __RStudio as a__ default __tool__ for doing univariate statistics and figures related to them, so far I've felt intimidated to take it further to analyzing multivariate data. Which is a shame, as I think in the long run it would be much more efficient (timewise) to use R for all the statistics I do. 
* From a less-programming/more-content point of view, the data I usually handle (plant secondary metabolites) tends to be multivariate and having a more variable set of multivariate methods in my statistical toolbox might yield important insights. Sadly, even if some of these methods have been covered in the basic statistics courses I took, it's been a while since then, and I don't feel confident enough to just start exploring and using the tools. So during the course I hope to develop a basic sense of 
  (@) __how to use the analytical tools for multivariate data__, 
  (@) __what kind of questions about my data I can answer with them__,  
and 
  (@) __what are the worst caveats I should avoid as a beginner.__
* I never used GitHub before but can't be too painful to learn, I hope.  

### Where did I found out about the course?
I read about the course from UEF Yammer some time ago, and got interested for (or despite) __the abovementioned reasons__, so here we are.
